                I joined Kentico at a time when it had already evolved from a CMS with developer DNA into an enterprise-ready platform with robust content, ecommerce, and marketing capabilities. The product earned positive feedback for its visual redesign—but adoption of its marketing features remained low.

              As the <strong>solo designer embedded in a small, autonomous product development team</strong>, I was responsible for making the marketing experience more intuitive and effective. I owned design execution end-to-end—from discovery and prototyping to usability testing and close collaboration with engineering. While overall product direction came from leadership, I had the autonomy to shape how those ideas were realized. I worked closely with my immediate team and stayed connected with the broader design group for critique and alignment.

              Our biggest project at the time was marketing campaigns overhaul. At its core, this project was about building empathy for the marketing user. The CMS had grown through developer-driven code reuse, but marketers worked with a very different mindset—and needed different affordances: guidance, clarity, and guardrails.

              I conducted lean but deep research to understand how marketers approached their jobs, where they struggled, and how the system’s mental model conflicted with their expectations. I made a point to regularly share these findings with engineers, ensuring they developed the same user empathy. In return, our technical conversations surfaced critical constraints and revealed the limitations of the newly introduced design system. That shared understanding helped us focus our efforts where they could have the most meaningful—and feasible—impact.

                As I worked across different flows, I began noticing recurring UI issues—both in implementation and interpretation. Developers and new designers often had the same questions, or made similar mistakes, when working with the interface. I took the initiative to identify these patterns and hosted informal workshops with developers to address common pitfalls. Beyond refining the visual language, I contributed to our internal pattern library—specifically focusing on what I called “decision recipes”: lightweight guidance for when to use a specific component and when not to. These additions helped reduce ambiguity, improve consistency, and made the system more usable for both creators and contributors.

            We ultimately prioritized campaign management—a capability where marketers frequently had to rely on developers for help, which was a clear barrier to adoption. Through continuous exploration, prototyping, and validation of the core campaign creation flow, we arrived at a solution that met marketer needs while staying within technical bounds. The feedback we received—from internal stakeholders and external users alike—confirmed that we were on the right track.        </p>
